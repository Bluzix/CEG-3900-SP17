#P1 - Introduction to Android Studio
This assignment from CEG 3900 was used to get us used to Android Studio and the Android Platform.
##Task 1 - Network APKs
We were given a list of APKs to choose from to install on our Android devices.  Some were helpful in transferring files, but most were showing off that Android can do the same networking things that a Linux machine can do.
##Task 2 - Android Development
We were told to install Android Studio and create a basic Android app.  The one I created was HelloThisIsMe.apk, which is a very simple app that just shows two activities: one to display the text through the XML Strings, and another to show the same text but set through Java methods.
##Task 3 - Build an Open Source Project
I had to choose an Open Source Project from http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/12-best-free-open-source-android-apps/ or https://guardianproject.info/apps.  I choose to build Mirakel from https://github.com/MirakelX/mirakel-android.  You can find my resulting app as mirakel.apk.
##Task 4 - Android Debug Bridge
This task was designed to get us familiar with the adb commands to install apks to our device and to access the shell of our device.  My device was a Lenovo Tab3 (TB3-850F).  I had to gather the mount points, bin, and xbin files from my device (mounts.txt, binFiles.txt, and xBinFiles.txt).
##Task 5 - Cloud Computing with AWS
This was a lab that made me work with Amazon's EC2 cloud services.  I used my Amazon account to start up a Linux server and then accessed a few programs that were on that machine from my own machine.  The server has been shut down.
