#P2 - Pruned Sudoku and Starting FireBase
This assignment was to turn [Open Sudoku](https://github.com/ogarcia/opensudoku) into Pruned Sudoku.  Pruned Sudoku would be an app that could only play a Sudoku puzzle, and would avoid all the extra features that used to be a part of Open Sudoku.  This assignment also had us download [FireBase Quickstart](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android) and build an apk from the Storage and Auth portions of it.
##Task 1 - Build Open Sudoku As-Is
This task just involved us downloading Open Sudoku, opening it in Android Studio, and getting it to build.  The result of this is openSudoku.apk.
##Task 2 - Prune Open Sudoku
This task was to take the source code of Open Sudoku, and remove all the features that weren't just filling out a Sudoku puzzle.  The goal was remove everything until you could just put numbers onto a blank grid.  My source code for this is in the prunedSudoku directory, and that built the prunedSudoku.apk.  My changes were documented in report-P2.pdf.
##Task 3 - FireBase Storage
This task was to take the source code of the FireBase Quickstart and build the Storage app from it.  You can do that by downloading the source, opening the storage directory in Android Studio, and making a few changes to get it to build with your current Build tools.  My result is fireBaseStorage.apk.
##Task 4 - FireBase Auth
This task was similar to Task 3, only getting the code in the auth directory to build.  My result is fireBaseAuth.apk.
##Task 5 - GitHub
This task made me get a GitHub account and upload my previous assignment to this site.  CEG-3900-SP17 is the repository for the class, and CEG-3900-SP17/P1 was my previous assignment.
