# CloudWebScannerClient
This was going to be the Java Command Line app that would be ran by a client computer.  I was thinking that I would need a Client and Host Java program to complete Task 3 and 4 of P4.  This app would have been called by the client device, which the User would then give it the file path of the text file containing URLs, and then the app would send this information off to the Host.  This app would also be where the User specified n, or the number of top used words in the pages of the URL list entries.  Sadly, I was only able to create the default baseline of a Java Command Line app; you can pretty much get my source code by selecting new -> Java Project -> Command Line Application in IntelliJ.

## How to use
This app doesn't do anything at the moment.
