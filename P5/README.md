# P5 - Android Front-End with Cloud Back-End
This lab was used to get us more familiar with using Cloud Computing platforms like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.  However, I wasn't able to do much for this lab in the given time.

## Task 1 - Program Comprehension "Uniting Twist"
Here we were to build [Uniting Twist]( https://github.com/Litun/UnitingTwist ) and write two documents.  One is a User-Level document: my UTwistUser.pdf.  The other one was a Developer-Level document: UTwistDev.pdf.  The User-Level document is more like an instruction manual for the end User.  The Developer-Level document is an explaination of the sensors used, and a detailed description of each class and what they are supposed to do for the app.  I also included a small description of each method in those classes as well.  Maybe, I spent a bit too much time writting these, and I probably went to deep into the details of each class.

## Task 2 - MS Azure Photo Uploader
Here we needed to build a working Photo Uploader app from [the source.]( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/storage-blob-android-photo-uploader/ )  I did manage to set up my Microsoft Azure account and get the app to build.  However, I didn't get the chance to test it.  I wasn't even able to upload my report detailing the work I had done to get it working.  I will leave the apk here as photoUploader.apk.  Please don't abuse the app or fill my Azure Storage Account with inappropriate pictures.

## Task 3 - Google Cloud Platform: Bookshelf App for Java
We were supposed to get a Google Cloud Platform account and build the app from the [tutorial]( https://cloud.google.com/java/getting-started/tutorial-app ), but I ran out of time for this lab.  This task also involved migrating the Maven to Gradle using this [guide.]( https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-from-maven/ )

## Task 4 - Collaborative Tagging of XKCD Cartoons
This Task had us download [Easy XKCD APK]( https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=xkcd&fdid=de.tap.easy_xkcd ) and observe how it worked.  Then we had to take [the APK's source code]( https://github.com/T-Rex96/Easy_xkcd ) and use one of the cloud platforms to create collaborative tagging on that app.  The Users of this app would be able to tag an XKCD comic and see what other Users of the same app have tagged the same comic.  The tags would then be used to sort the comics out.  I did not get the time to work on this one.

## Task 5 - Analyses of Password Dumps
In this Task, we had to design an app to help ordinary or non-computer savvy people find a good password to use.  The Users would give us a password they want to use, then we would check it using [word lists.]( http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/3900/Lectures/Passwords/password-labs.html#sec-5-1 )  I didn't get a chance to start this, but this app will have to be created in P6.
